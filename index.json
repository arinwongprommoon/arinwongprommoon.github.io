One such example is the metabolic cycle in budding yeast, which consists of cycling levels of metabolites, RNA transcripts, and oxygen consumption over time. Most studies on this cycle have been performed with chemostats, in batch-cultures. Though there are more recent studies that image cells individually, it is unclear how to reconcile finding from the two types of experiments.\nIn this preprint, we show that pH levels in yeast cells also oscillate along with flavin redox state. These oscillations are present across a greater range of nutrient conditions and yeast mutants than observed before, including conditions in which such oscillations were disrupted in chemostats.\nTo explain why these oscillations are so prevalent, we used flux balance analysis – a linear programming-based mathematical method to model biochemical reaction networks. With this tool, we show that, if a cell with a finite level of amino acids makes its biological building blocks (proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, etc.) in sequence, it saves time on growth. Thus, This sequence of synthesis may explain the metabolic oscillations.\nMy role This work represents a fusion of multiple disciplines and tools. To observe the cells, I needed to learn how to use a microfluidics device with so many moving parts. Monitoring cell division was made possible by using CRISPR-Cas9 to engineer a genetic insertion (and I learnt how to do this while social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic). The time-lapse microscope produces a lot of images, so the research group needed to develop new software to process them and I wrote functions to perform time-series analysis. Finally, we used a tool from metabolic engineering, flux balance analysis, to help formulate a theoretical explanation of our observations.\nI also co-wrote the initial draft of the manuscript, and documented the datasets and code.\n","date":1732579200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1732579200,"objectID":"db46339f8a6cfbdde4ea2b6cda475cd4","permalink":"https://arinwongprommoon.github.io/publication/wongprommoonsinglecellmetabolicoscillations/","publishdate":"2024-11-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wongprommoonsinglecellmetabolicoscillations/","section":"publication","summary":"Biological rhythms not only coordinate cellular activity with external signals, but may also enable internal coordination. The metabolic cycle in budding yeast is perhaps the most well-studied example. Historically researchers have investigated this cycle in populations growing in chemostats, but more recently time-lapse microscopy has revealed single-cell oscillations in the redox state of enzyme cofactors and in ATP levels. How to relate the results of these two types of assays is however unclear. Here we report single-cell rhythms too in intracellular pH and show that oscillations in the redox state of flavin molecules occur in auxotrophic and prototrophic strains, in nutrients favouring respiration or fermentation, and in deletion mutants for which oscillations in chemostats are either unobservable or disrupted. To explain the pervasiveness of these rhythms, we postulate that cells generate oscillations to alleviate a proteome constraint -- amino acids cells use for one class of enzymes are unavailable for others. Using flux balance analysis with an enzyme-constrained genome-scale metabolic model, we show that, with a finite proteome, sequential synthesis of biomass components typically generates a shorter doubling time than synthesising components in parallel. Our results suggest that the metabolic cycle drives growth and is potentially widespread because all cells grow within a proteome constraint.","tags":["Microfluidics","Live-cell imaging","Yeast","Metabolism","Metabolic modelling","Time series analysis"],"title":"Single-cell metabolic oscillations are pervasive and may alleviate a proteome constraint","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sukritpong Pakdeerat","Chalita Chomkatekaew","Phumrapee Boonklang","Arin Wongprommoon","Kesorn Angchagun","Yaowaret Dokket","Areeya Faosap","Gumphol Wongsuwan","Premjit Amornchai","Vanaporn Wuthiekanun","Jirameth Changklom","Suwatthiya Siriboon","Parinya Chamnan","Sharon J Peacock","Jukka Corander","Nicholas PJ Day","Nicholas R Thomson","Chayasith Uttamapinant","Somsakul Pop Wongpalee","Claire Chewapreecha"],"categories":null,"content":"Lay summary Melioidosis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, which can be acquired from the environment through contact with soil or water. However, no previous studies established a statistically significant relationship between B. pseudomallei in the local environment and melioidosis cases, mostly because of low abundance of the bacterium and inconsistent sampling methods.\nWe recently developed a CRISPR-based method to detect B. pseudomallei and compared it with conventional microbial culture methods on how well it detects the bacterium in water samples from northeast Thailand. We found that our method is far more sensitive (able to pick up the bacterium in most samples with it) and equally specific (able to rule out the bacterium in most samples without it) compared to culture-based methods.\nAdditionally, we collected water samples, clinical information, and demographic information associated with people in the endemic area. We found exposure to B. pseudomallei in water sources, being an agricultural worker, and diabetes increased the risk of melioidosis.\nMy role I performed a literature search which shows that molecular-based techniques (detecting DNA or RNA) had twice the test positivity rate as culture-based techniques (growing the bacterium on agar and finding colonies by eye).\nI also processed and analysed the clinical data: I grouped the study participants’ occupation codes and produced a summary of the demographic characteristics of the population (ages, sexes, BMIs, blood glucose level, etc.).\n","date":1732320000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1732320000,"objectID":"047ccbcdab7d98c9846752acad22ff9e","permalink":"https://arinwongprommoon.github.io/publication/pakdeeratenvironmentaldetectionburkholderia2024/","publishdate":"2024-11-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pakdeeratenvironmentaldetectionburkholderia2024/","section":"publication","summary":"**Background:** Environmental acquisition of _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ can cause melioidosis, a life-threatening yet underreported disease. Understanding environmental exposure is essential for effective public health interventions, yet existing tools are limited in their ability to quantify exposure risks. **Methods:** We conducted two complementary studies across a 15,118 km2 area of northeast Thailand to improve detection methods and investigate risk factors for melioidosis. In the first study, we compared a newly developed, equipment-light CRISPR-based assay (CRISPR-BP34) with conventional culture methods using both spiked samples and real water samples from household and community sources (November 2020 - November 2021). The second study involved a case-control analysis of 1,135 participants (October 2019 - January 2023) to evaluate the association between environmental exposure to _B. pseudomallei_ (detected in Study 1) and melioidosis risk. **Findings:** The CRISPR-BP34 assay demonstrated improved sensitivity (93.52% vs 19.44% for conventional methods) and specificity (100% vs 97.98%), allowing for more accurate detection of _B. pseudomallei_ and exposure risk quantification. Environmental exposure to _B. pseudomallei_ in water sources within a 10 km radius of participants’ households was significantly associated with increased melioidosis risk (OR: 2.74 [95% CI 1.38-5.48]). This risk was also heightened by known factors: occupational exposure among agricultural workers (4.46 [2.91-6.91]), and health factors like elevated hemoglobin A1c, indicating diabetes (1.35 [1.19-1.31]). **Interpretation:** Our findings underscore the impact of environmental contamination on melioidosis risk. The robust association between contaminated water sources, including piped water systems, and clinical cases highlights the urgent need for improved water sanitation to mitigate melioidosis risk.","tags":["Infectious disease","Public health","Melioidosis","Diagnostics","Demographics"],"title":"Environmental detection of Burkholderia pseudomallei and associated melioidosis risk: a molecular detection and case-control cohort study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jorge Lázaro","Arin Wongprommoon","Jorge Júlvez","Stephen G.

Genome-scale constraint-based metabolic models account for most reactions that can occur in a cell and can be used to predict how much a genetically engineered microbe can produce an industrially relevant compound.\nHowever, a common method to simulate constraint-based metabolic models forces cellular reactions to either be optimised only for growth or only for production of the new compound – neither of which is realistic. We solve this problem for E. coli producing citramalate by using information from another type of metabolic model to constrain the reaction fluxes in the base constraint-based model for E. coli.\n","date":1720915200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1720915200,"objectID":"5b9e2b57c62e718940ab4cf4fc3bc69f","permalink":"https://arinwongprommoon.github.io/publication/lazaroenhancingaccuracygenomescale2024/","publishdate":"2024-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lazaroenhancingaccuracygenomescale2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Metabolic models can be used to analyze and predict cellular features such as growth estimation, gene essentiality, and product formation. Metabolic models can be divided into two main types: constraint-based models and kinetic models. Constraint-based models usually account for a large subset of the metabolic reactions of the organism and, in addition to the reaction stoichiometry, these models can accommodate gene regulation and constant flux bounds of the reactions. Constraint-based models are mostly limited to the steady state and it is challenging to optimize competing objective functions. On the other hand, kinetic models contain detailed kinetic information of a relatively small subset of metabolic reactions; thus, they can only provide precise predictions of a reduced part of an organism’s metabolism. We propose an approach that combines these two types of models to enrich metabolic genome-scale constraint-based models by re-defining their flux bounds. We apply our approach to the constraint-based model of E. coli, both as a wild-type and when genetically modified to produce citramalate. Consequently, we show that the enriched model has more realistic reaction flux boundaries. We also resolve a bifurcation of fluxes between growth and citramalate production present in the genetically modified model by fixing the growth rate to the value computed according to kinetic information, enabling us to predict the rate of citramalate production.","tags":["Metabolism","Metabolic modelling"],"title":"Enhancing the accuracy of genome-scale metabolic models with kinetic information","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arin Wongprommoon","Chalita Chomkatekaew","Claire Chewapreecha"],"categories":null,"content":"Lay summary My team members (Chalita Chomkatekaew, Claire Chewapreecha) and I wrote a short article, which reviews six recent studies that sample genetic material from wastewater to track spread of pathogens.\nWastewater genomic surveillance is useful for tracking spread of pathogens because it is less biased than sampling individuals with diagnostic testing.

This yeast metabolic cycle is defined by levels of metabolites in the cell increasing and decreasing in regular cycles, which are linked to cell division. Changing feeding conditions for the yeast cells or removing genes from the yeast genome that are responsible for metabolic processes affect the speed of these metabolic cycles.\nNot a lot of people study this cycle. Those who do study them in chemostats – essentially, large liquid cultures of many cells – so it is difficult to see whether individual cells behave differently. This is why I used microfluidics to separate the cells. Microfluidics refers to an experimental system that moves around small amounts of liquids – in my case, I used microfluidics to move cells from cultures, trap \u0026amp; separate them, then add or remove nutrients over time.\nMy project had three parts:\nFind out ways to analyse the thousands of oscillatory time series I produced. Microfluidics is nice because I got data from many cells. But then I had to clean, process, and categorise this data. I also found out that commonly-used computational methods to compute the periodicity of data, such as the Fourier transform, did not work so well with the noisy biological data I have. My aim was then to find alternative methods, and to combine them with other data-processing steps in a data analysis pipeline. In this code repository, I investigated how noise in the data affect some analysis methods. And using this repository, I used machine learning to tell apart oscillatory and non-oscillatory signals. Show that the metabolic cycle occurs in a variety of cell conditions. My hypothesis here was that the metabolic cycle is something fundamental in the yeast cell, therefore I should be able to see oscillations in metabolite levels when the cells have certain genes removed, or are starved of nutrients. So far, so good. Here is the code that I used to process the data I obtain from my microfluidics experiments to produce reports of the cells in each experiment. Use mathematical models of metabolism to explain why yeast cells have these metabolic cycles. More specifically, I answered the question: does it make sense for the cell to make different building blocks (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) at different times, and do these times fit with the periodicity of the metabolic cycle that I observed in experiments? To do this, I used a genome-scale metabolic model – essentially, a list of chemical reactions that can happen in the yeast cell – and solved linear programming problems to see how fast each reaction should be so that the cell grows as fast as possible. Here is the code that I used to solve these problems. In addition, I was part of the team that developed aliby, a Python-based pipeline that Prof Peter Swain’s research group uses to analyse time-lapses of images of yeast cells taken from the microscopes in their microfluidics systems. This pipeline finds cells in the images (segmentation), keeps track of cells as they move through time (tracking), match new cells to the ones they divided from (lineage prediction), and creates time series for further processing. I used this software extensively in part 2 of my project.\nFor me, this was a valuable foray in collaborative software development. Of course, I sharpened my Python skills, but also DevOps: automated testing and deployment of software, managing software versions, maintaining servers for users, and making sure things don’t crash and burn. I learnt how to talk to other developers, project managers, and users (biologist and physicists) of varying programming or technical abilities. Naturally, I learnt to navigate lots and lots and lots of conflicts – both merge conflicts and inevitable conflicts between ideas!\nMy PhD work eventually led to a paper that showed that single-cell metabolic oscillations are pervasive and may alleviate a proteome constraint. During my PhD, I also worked on a paper on the accuracy and data efficiency in deep learning models of protein expression.\n","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569888000,"objectID":"9723547690e3a2bfcc5abe05ad0b6994","permalink":"https://arinwongprommoon.github.io/project/phd/","publishdate":"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/phd/","section":"project","summary":"PhD Project","tags":["Microfluidics","Live-cell imaging","Yeast","Metabolism","Metabolic modelling","Machine Learning","Time series analysis","Software development"],"title":"PhD Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Bee venom contains a protein called melittin. We want to know if it kills lung cancer cells and stops macrophages – a type of white blood cell – from changing cell type. Macrophages are important as it changes behaviour in lung cancer.\nWe tested melittin on:\nhow well it kills lung cancer cells, how well it stops lung cancer cells from dividing, how it affects macrophages moving and changing cell type, how it affects the cancer producing a chemical that makes blood vessels grow towards it, and how it affects the levels of RNAs that show the activity of lung cancer cells. We found that melittin does indeed kill cancer cells and stop them from dividing, if we use a particular concentration. Melittin also stops macrophages from changing cell type. However, melittin does not change how well the cancer tells the body to make new blood vessels. We also saw how melittin change how lung cancer cells produce RNAs that instruct processes in the cell.\nSo, we think doctors can use melittin to treat lung cancer.\nMy role I performed some experiments. I added melittin in various concentrations to see which concentration kills the lung cancer cells. This work became figure 5 in the paper.

Although many compounds isolated from natural products have been used to treat it, drug resistance is a serious problem, and alternative anti-cancer drugs are required. Here, melittin from Apis mellifera venom was used, and its effects on bronchogenic carcinoma cell proliferation and tumour-associated macrophage differentiation were evaluated. **Methods:** The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of melittin was measured by MTT. Cell death was observed by annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) co-staining followed by flow cytometry. Cell cycle arrest was revealed by PI staining and flow cytometry. To investigate the tumour microenvironment, differentiation of circulating monocytes (THP-1) into tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) was assayed by sandwich-ELISA and interleukin (IL)-10 levels were determined. Cell proliferation and migration was observed by flat plate colony formation. Secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was detected by ELISA. The change in expression levels of CatS, Bcl-2, and MADD was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. **Results:** Melittin was significantly more cytotoxic (p \u003c 0.01) to human bronchogenic carcinoma cells (ChaGo-K1) than to the control human lung fibroblasts (Wi-38) cells. At 2.5 μM, melittin caused ChaGo-K1 cells to undergo apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. The IL-10 levels showed that melittin significantly inhibited the differentiation of THP-1 cells into TAMs (p \u003c 0.05) and reduced the number of colonies formed in the treated ChaGo-K1 cells compared to the untreated cells. However, melittin did not affect angiogenesis in ChaGo-K1 cells. Unlike MADD, Bcl-2 was up-regulated significantly (p \u003c 0.05) in melittin-treated ChaGo-K1 cells. **Conclusion:** Melittin can be used as an alternative agent for lung cancer treatment because of its cytotoxicity against ChaGo-K1 cells and the inhibition of differentiation of THP-1 cells into TAMs.","tags":["Cancer","Cancer treatment","Tumour microenvironment","Immunology","Developmental biology"],"title":"Melittin Induced G1 Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis in Chago-K1 Human Bronchogenic Carcinoma Cells and Inhibited the Differentiation of THP-1 Cells into Tumour-Associated Macrophages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bill Jia","Arin Wongprommoon"],"categories":null,"content":"Lay summary Synthetic biology is a field of science that applies engineering principles to living organisms. This short opinion piece shows three examples of its use.\nA team in Cambridge (UK) assembled a piece of DNA that can make bacteria change colour based on the concentration of a chemical that the bacterial cells use to talk to each other. This system could be changed to make complicated patterns. People use bacteria like this to make drugs. So, creating patterns in space is useful because it separates steps in drug production that interfere with each other. A team at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign assembled pieces of DNA that, when put into bacteria, make them mimic ecological interactions. These interactions included cooperation between species, competition between species, and one species eating another. Studying the interactions between microbes is useful because these interactions are present in the human gut and in the soil. But, engineering these interactions in order to understand them is difficult. MRSA is a drug-resistant bacterium that can cause serious infections in hospitals. The human immune system kills MRSA in a process that involves many immune cells and chemicals that the cells make to talk to each other. A team at the University of Basel (Switzerland) engineered synthetic human cells that short-cut some steps of the immune response and put the entire process in one cell. The synthetic cell could detect and prevent MRSA infection very well. My role Bill and I equally contributed to this article. I mainly wrote about the MRSA study.\nBioTechniques had a connection with the Cambridge University Synthetic Biology Society and regularly invited leaders of the society to write articles about synthetic biology. In the society, students design projects in synthetic biology and organise teaching workshops in both the laboratory and computation sides of the discipline.\n","date":1537315200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537315200,"objectID":"6ce13d4517b3220f939436bb5f9ef3ae","permalink":"https://arinwongprommoon.github.io/publication/jiasyntheticbiologyengineering2018/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jiasyntheticbiologyengineering2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Synthetic biology has enormous potential to solve problems in health, agriculture, and energy.
